# 🚀 JMeter Performance Testing Project

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a **performance test** conducted using **Apache JMeter** to evaluate system scalability, stability, and response efficiency under heavy user load.

## ⚙️ Test Configuration
- **Tool Used:** Apache JMeter  
- **Number of Threads (Users):** 500  
- **Ramp-up Period:** 5 seconds  
- **Loop Count:** 1  
- **Protocol:** HTTP/HTTPS  

## 🎯 Test Objective
To measure the system’s ability to handle concurrent user requests and maintain consistent performance without errors.

## 📊 Test Results
| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Response Code** | 201 (Created) | Indicates successful request creation |
| **Average Load Time** | 482 ms | Time taken to complete a request |
| **Latency** | 482 ms | Time between request and first response |
| **Connect Time** | 39 ms | Time to establish connection |
| **Error %** | 0% | All requests succeeded |

✅ **Result:** The system demonstrated strong stability and performance under high load conditions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Apache JMeter  
- Java (for running JMeter)  
- CSV Data Config
- JMeter HTML Dashboard Report  


## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Importance of ramp-up time in simulating real-world traffic.
- How to analyze response metrics (load time, latency, throughput).
- Identifying system bottlenecks under peak load.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The test confirmed that the system can efficiently manage **500 concurrent users** with **minimal latency and no errors**, ensuring optimal scalability and reliability.
